## Layers
| Layer | Legend |
| ----- | ------ |
| Base  |  Top left (black) |
| Lower | Bottom right (red) |
| Raise | Top right (orange) |
| Adjust | Front print |

## Features
* Raise/lower layers focus first on one-handed use
* Numpad on right hand with raise layer
* Navigation on left hand with lower layer (ESDF)
    * D refers to desktop left/right on Win 10 (win+ctrl+left/right)
* Heavy use of hold/tap dual function keys - from left to right:
    * Cmd/Enter
    * Lower/Tab
    * Shift/Esc
    * Ctrl/Backspace
    * Ctrl/Delete
    * Shift/Space
    * Raise/Tab
    * Alt/Enter


## Modifier Placement Rationale

There are several major driving forces at play:

* I use MacOS.
* I'm Danish so the Alt and Shift-Alt layers in MacOS simply have to work.
* I use Vim for coding.
* I use org-mode in Emacs to keep track of my time.

Given that Sleipnir has four modifier keys for each thumb instead of the three that Minidox has it is easier to address the main usage patterns.

* Space is on the right hand side because I almost exclusively use my right hand thumb for
  space.
* Due to my usage of Vim Esc got a spot on the modifier row.
* Tab is on both sides to allow for flexible usage with other modifier keys. Only having it on the right on the Minidox wasn't always the best for all scenarios.
* Shift and Ctrl are on both sides to allow for flexible interaction with combos involving Cmd and Alt.
* Now that Ctrl is available on both sides Raise and Lower switch sides, ie, Lower on the left and Raise on the right. That means that the arrow keys can be operated with just the left hand and vice versa for the numpad on the right.
